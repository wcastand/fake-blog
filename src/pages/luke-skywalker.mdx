# Luke Skywalker

Luke Skywalker is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the original film trilogy of the Star Wars franchise created by George Lucas. Portrayed by Mark Hamill, Luke first appeared in Star Wars (1977), and he returned in The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). Three decades later, he portrayed the character in the Star Wars sequel trilogy, appearing in all three films: The Force Awakens (2015), The Last Jedi (2017), and The Rise of Skywalker (2019).

Originally a farmer on Tatooine living with his uncle and aunt, who are later killed by stormtroopers, Luke becomes a pivotal figure in the Rebel Alliance's struggle against the Galactic Empire, a friend and eventual brother-in-law of smuggler Han Solo, and unknown to him until Return of the Jedi, the twin brother of Rebellion leader Princess Leia. He trains to be a Jedi under Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda, and is the son of fallen Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker (turned Sith Lord Darth Vader) and Padmé Amidala. He mentors the sequel trilogy's protagonist, Rey, and is the maternal uncle and the former Jedi trainer of its antagonist, Kylo Ren. Though Luke dies at the end of The Last Jedi, he returns as a Force spirit in The Rise of Skywalker, encouraging Rey to face the revived Emperor Palpatine and empowering her alongside the spirits of other former Jedi during her final confrontation with him. His ghost also appears in the film's epilogue scene alongside his sister's, who died redeeming Kylo Ren earlier in the film.

The character also briefly appears in the prequel film Episode III – Revenge of the Sith as an infant. The Expanded Universe, which has been declared non-canonical, depicts him as a powerful Jedi Master, the husband of Mara Jade, father of Ben Skywalker and maternal uncle of Jaina, Jacen and Anakin Solo.

## Appearances

#### Skywalker saga

Original trilogy
Main article: Star Wars Trilogy
In the original Star Wars trilogy, Luke Skywalker represents the hero archetype of "the young man, called to adventure, the hero going out facing the trials and ordeals, and coming back after his victory with a boon for the community".

#### A New Hope (1977)

In a deleted scene preceding the character's first appearance in the film (preserved in the film's radio dramatization), Luke says goodbye to his best friend Biggs Darklighter, who has just joined the Imperial Academy. His childhood friends disparagingly call him "Wormie".

In the original 1977 film (later having the extended title, A New Hope), Luke lives at a moisture farm on the desert planet of Tatooine with his Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru. Luke takes his first steps toward his destiny when he purchases the droids C-3PO and R2-D2. While examining R2-D2, he sees a message from Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan. When R2-D2 goes missing, Luke goes out to search for the droid, and is saved from a band of Tusken Raiders by Obi-Wan Kenobi, an old hermit. Luke and Obi-Wan retreat to the latter’s home, and R2-D2 plays the full message for Obi-Wan from Leia, beseeching him to help her defeat the Galactic Empire. Obi-Wan says that he and Luke's father were once Jedi Knights, and that his father was murdered by a traitorous Jedi named Darth Vader. Obi-Wan presents Luke with his father's lightsaber and offers to take him to Alderaan and train him in the ways of the Force, but Luke declines his offer, feeling obligated to continue farming for his uncle.

Luke changes his mind when he returns home to find out that Imperial stormtroopers have raided the moisture farm, killing his aunt and uncle while away. He and Obi-Wan then travel to Mos Eisley, where they meet smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca at a cantina. They team up and travel on the Millennium Falcon to Alderaan, only to find out that it has been destroyed by the Death Star. The Falcon is brought into the Star's hangar bay via tractor beam, where Luke and Han disguise themselves and infiltrate the station. When they discover Princess Leia is there, Luke persuades a reluctant Han and Chewbacca to help rescue her. Obi-Wan deactivates the tractor beam, and he later sacrifices his life in a duel with Vader, so that Luke and his friends can board the Falcon and escape.

During the Battle of Yavin, Luke joins the Rebel Alliance in attacking the Death Star. In the trench leading to the Death Star's exhaust port, Luke hears Obi-Wan's voice, telling him to "trust his feelings"; he takes Obi-Wan's advice and switches off his X-wing's missile guidance system, instead using the Force to guide the missiles and destroy the Death Star. In the film's final scene, he joins Han and Chewbacca in receiving a medal of honor for his heroism.

#### The Empire Strikes Back (1980)

Three years after the destruction of the Death Star, Luke is now the commander of the Rebel Alliance's Rogue Squadron. While on a mission on the ice planet Hoth, he is captured by a wampa, but manages to escape using his lightsaber. In the frozen wasteland, he sees Obi-Wan's Force ghost, who tells him to travel to the planet Dagobah and complete his training with the Jedi Master Yoda. Luke collapses but is later rescued by Han. When the Empire discovers the Rebel base on Hoth, Luke leads his squadron of Snowspeeders to battle the enemy’s AT-ATs, but he is forced to retreat when his wingmen are overwhelmed. Escaping in his X-wing, he travels to Dagobah and meets Yoda. He undergoes rigorous Jedi training, quickly increasing his power in the Force.

During his training, Luke sees a vision of his friends in danger. Against both Obi-Wan and Yoda's advice to stay and complete his training, he travels to Bespin to save them, unwittingly falling into a trap placed by Darth Vader. He engages in a lightsaber duel with Vader. As his mentors warned, Luke proves to be no match for Vader; the Sith Lord easily overpowers Luke and severs his right hand. Vader then reveals that he is Luke's father, and offers him the chance to turn to the dark side of the Force and rule the galaxy at his side. Resolving that he would rather die than become an agent of evil, Luke throws himself into a deep reactor chasm. He survives, but is pulled into a garbage chute to the underside of Cloud City, and left hanging perilously onto a vane rod. Leia, flying away from Cloud City in the Millennium Falcon, senses Luke's call out to her with the Force, and turns the ship around to save him. Aboard the ship, he hears Vader telepathically telling him that it is his destiny to join the dark side. Luke's severed hand is replaced with a bio-mechanical one.

#### Return of the Jedi (1983)

One year after the invasion on Bespin, Luke is now a Jedi Knight, and has constructed his own lightsaber. He returns to Tatooine with Leia, the droids, and Lando Calrissian to save Han, frozen in carbonate, from the crime lord Jabba the Hutt. Luke offers to negotiate with Jabba, who rejects his offer and casts him into a pit to battle a rancor. When Luke kills the rancor, he is sentenced to death in the Sarlacc Pit. Luke escapes with R2-D2's help, saving his friends and destroying Jabba's sail barge.

Luke returns to Dagobah, and learns from a dying Yoda that Vader is indeed his father. Luke then learns from Obi-Wan's spirit that he has a twin sister, whom he immediately realizes is princess Leia. Both Jedi Masters tell Luke that he must face Vader again to finish his training and save the galaxy, but he is disturbed by the idea of killing his own father.

Arriving on Endor as part of a Rebel commando squad, Luke surrenders to Vader in an attempt to bring his father back from the dark side of the Force. Vader brings Luke to the second Death Star orbiting around Endor, where his master, Emperor Palpatine, tries to tempt Luke to the dark side, revealing his plan to destroy the Rebel fleet. Luke, enraged at the thought of losing his friends, lashes out at the Emperor with his lightsaber, but Vader blocks his strike, and father and son once again duel with each other. Luke regains control of his emotions until Vader senses that Luke has a sister, and threatens to turn her to the dark side if Luke will not submit. Luke snaps and overpowers Vader, severing his father's mechanical right hand. The Emperor orders Luke to kill Vader and then take his place. Luke looks at his own bionic hand and realizes that he is on the verge of suffering his father's fate. He casts his lightsaber aside, declaring himself a Jedi.

Furious, the Emperor tortures Luke with Force lightning. In agony, Luke calls out to his father for help; unwilling to let his son die, Vader throws the Emperor down a reactor shaft, but is mortally wounded by the Emperor's force lightning in the process. As Rebel fighters head toward the Death Star's main reactor, Luke removes Vader's mask and looks upon his father's real face for the first and last time. The redeemed Anakin Skywalker reassures Luke that there was good in him after all before dying, and to tell his sister that he was right about him. On Endor, Luke burns his father's armor and prosthetics on a funeral pyre, giving him a proper Jedi funeral. During the Rebels' victory celebrations on Endor, Luke sees his father's spirit appear alongside those of Obi-Wan and Yoda.

### Prequel trilogy

#### Revenge of the Sith (2005)

In the prequel film Revenge of the Sith (2005), during the waning days of the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Separatists, Senator Padmé Amidala became pregnant to Luke and his twin sister Leia. Foreseen fear of Padmé dying from the birth of Luke and Leia became a primary catalyst into Anakin Skywalker's fall to the dark side as Darth Vader by Sheev Palpatine, who had secretly orchestrated the Clone Wars from both sides in order to transform the democratic Galactic Republic into the autocratic Galactic Empire mere days before Luke's birth. Anakin had sought to obtain enough power to save Padmé from dying after going through a similar nightmare with his mother, who died at the hands of Tusken Raiders on Tatooine during Attack of the Clones 3 years prior. After becoming distrusted with the Jedi order, Anakin took Palpatine's bait that as a Sith he would learn the power of keeping the ones he cared about from dying. After following Palpatine's orders to raid the Jedi Temple and killing young Jedi aspirants, Anakin traveled to the volcanic planet Mustafar to kill off the Separatist leaders, effectively ending the Clone Wars. It was there when Padmé arrive and learn of what Anakin had become, saying that he was breaking her heart. Following a dual between Anakin and his former master Obi-Wan Kenobi that resulted in the former being burned badly next to a lava river, Padmé was taken to Polis Massa after being force choked by Anakin out of betrayal when Obi-Wan secretly appeared out of her starship. After giving birth to Luke and Leia, Padmé died, having lost the will to live. At the time Darth Vader, who had been saved by Palptine and placed on a black lifesuit, wasn't aware that Padmé had given birth to twins, believing that he killed her out of his anger. After the twins were separated in order to be protected from the Sith, Luke is taken by Obi-Wan Kenobi to the desert planet Tatooine, where Luke is adopted by his father's stepbrother, Owen Lars, and his wife, Beru. The infant Luke is portrayed by Aidan Barton, the son of Roger Barton, an editor of the film.

### Sequel trilogy

#### The Force Awakens (2015)

In the first installment of the sequel trilogy, The Force Awakens (2015), the opening crawl reveals that Luke Skywalker had mysteriously vanished some time in the thirty years after the destruction of the second Death Star. Luke went into hiding after his nephew and apprentice, Ben Solo, turned to the dark side and was later dubbed Kylo Ren. When Ren killed all of his fellow apprentices and ushered in the despotic reign of the First Order, Luke felt responsible, and disappeared. At the end of the film, the Resistance manage to reconstruct a map, which traces the location of the temple from the Empire's archives to his location, and he is subsequently found on the planet Ahch-To by the young scavenger, Rey, who presents him with the lightsaber previously wielded by both Luke and his father.

The Art of Star Wars: The Last Jedi notes that Luke's exile is a reversal from his decision to help his friends in The Empire Strikes Back.

#### The Last Jedi (2017)

In The Last Jedi (2017), Luke throws the lightsaber away after being given it by Rey. He then seals himself in his home, refusing to talk with Rey. However, when he sees Chewbacca without Han Solo and that Rey came on the Millennium Falcon, he inquires about what has gone on with his family. Rey informs Luke about Solo's death at the hands of Kylo Ren and that the First Order has risen to rule the galaxy. Rey asks Luke to train her in the ways of the Force. Luke is initially reluctant to train Rey, telling her that it is time for the Jedi Order to end.

After some persuasion from R2-D2, Luke starts training Rey, originally for the purpose of showing her why the Jedi Order needs to end, but grows increasingly afraid of her power. Luke then tells Rey the history of the Jedi Order, how Palpatine rose to power and how the Jedi were partly responsible for Darth Vader's rise. Luke also initially tells Rey that Kylo was corrupted by Supreme Leader Snoke and that when he confronted his nephew, he retaliated by destroying his Jedi temple. This is proven false, however, and, after a furious moment with his new apprentice, Luke tells Rey that he had briefly considered killing the sleeping Ben after seeing a vision of the destruction he could cause, but immediately relented; Ben woke to see Luke with his lightsaber drawn and turned to the dark side because he felt betrayed. Upon learning this, Rey urges Luke to help her redeem Ben, but he refuses to participate in this nor help the Resistance, saying, "This is NOT going to go the way you think." When Rey leaves, an embittered Luke tries to burn the Jedi temple next to his home on Ahch-To, but fails and is visited by the spirit of Yoda, who assures Luke that he still has a purpose.

Luke appears on the planet Crait, as the Resistance are staging a standoff against the First Order, and he apologizes to Leia for allowing Ben to fall to the dark side. Luke steps in front of the First Order's artillery, and unexpectedly survives an onslaught of blaster fire ordered by Ren. Ren charges at Luke in hand-to-hand combat, seemingly bisecting him with his lightsaber, but Luke remains unscathed; still on Ahch-To, Luke has sent a projection of himself to Crait, using the Force. This distraction allows the Resistance to escape the planet. Luke tells Kylo that he will not be the last Jedi before his projection disappears. On Ahch-To, Luke collapses then looks off in the horizon to see the planet's two suns setting before he becomes one with the Force and vanishes.

#### The Rise of Skywalker (2019)

Luke appears briefly in The Rise of Skywalker, the ninth and final chapter of the series. When Rey discovers her lineage as the granddaughter of Emperor Palpatine, she exiles herself on Ahch-To as Luke did. Meaning to isolate herself, she throws Luke's lightsaber towards the burning wreckage of the TIE fighter she had traveled there with. Luke appears as a Force ghost, and reprimands Rey for treating the lightsaber with disrespect just as he did. Luke then admits that he was wrong to not participate in the Resistance, and thanks Rey for helping him rediscover himself. Luke convinces Rey to not view herself as a Palpatine, but as the good person Leia saw her as when training her, and not to give up on her battle against the Emperor. Luke lends Rey his old X-wing and tells Rey to combine his father's lightsaber with Leia's old lightsaber in her battle on Exegol.

After Rey vanquishes Palpatine once and for all, she visits the moisture farm on Tatooine where Luke was raised. She buries Luke and Leia's lightsabers, revealing that she has constructed her own. A local asks Rey who she is. As Leia, who died earlier, and Luke appear as Force ghosts, Rey names herself Rey Skywalker.
